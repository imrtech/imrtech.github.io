## Project Overview
In this project we created a dashboard that displayed information about bacteria found in human belly buttons from a sample of volunteers. The visualizations in the dashboard display each person's demographic information, top 10 bacteria found, how frequently they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample.

## Result

We built out the dropdown list, bar chart, gauge chart and bubble chart using Javascript, Plotly and HTML.  
- When an ID is selected from the dropdown menu, demographic information for the selected volunteer is displayed, and the three charts are updated.
